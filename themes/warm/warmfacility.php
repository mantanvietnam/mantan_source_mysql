                                    Vietnam is one of the countries most severely affected by climate change and natural disasters. Rising temperatures and sea levels, as well as the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, combined with population growth and rapid urbanization, increase the risk of coastal erosion, flooding and drought. Therefore, sustainable water and natural resources management has emerged as a critical challenge for cities, rural and urban areas. In line with their international commitments on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, the European Union (EU) and Agence Française de Développment (AFD) actively support Vietnam in the areas of climate change mitigation (energy transition) and adaptation by 2050.                                </div>

                                    The WARM Facility focuses on the main priorities of the country in terms of climate change adaptation, through resilient cities in response to water-related hazards. It contributes to the implementation of #Global Gateway Strategy launched by the EU since 2021 to provide the framework for the EU's external action in an evolving international context, and deepen EU's engagement to accelerate investment in quality infrastructure in low-and-middle income countries and strengthen the global economy.

                                    The WARM Facility, a grant of 20 million euro financed by the EU, is dedicated to AFD for management and implementation. It supports the preparation and implementation of infrastructure investment projects in the areas of water and natural resources management, to strengthen the Vietnam's resilience to climate change. These investment projects are co-financed by AFD loans and Vietnam’s own resources over the period 2021-2029, for a total estimated amount of 200 million euro.

                                    The technical assistance financed by the WARM Facility allows long-term in country capacity of the main stakeholders involved in the project implementation and infrastructure management.

                                    Finally, the experiences gained from these projects feed into the sectoral policy dialogue of the EU and AFD with the government on the climate, environment and natural resources management through cross-cutting activities, such as technical exchanges and thematic workshops.

                        Economically, full advantage of the natural resource management is taken along with assurance of economic and financial profitability and sustainability of the investments. Socially, WARM helps to maximize the social impact of investment projects through the support of structural social improvements, such as gender equality or participative planning and management of the natural resources or infrastructures. The need of all users of the natural resources (water, land and/or forest), including marginalized and poorer user groups, is taken in consideration in allocating the natural resources. This will contribute to prevent conflicts among natural resource users, which are a major challenge in a context of climate change.
